Ignition is a 2nd stage bootloader & operating system for the Fleshlight Launch. It is intended as a replacement for the original firmware, providing a fast bootloader as well as a simple programming interface to control the Launch.

Installation
============

Ignition by itself does nothing, an application such as [Liftoff](https://github.com/cfs6t08p/liftoff) must be installed after Ignition has been installed!

Ignition can be installed using the [Metafetish Unofficial Kiiroo Firmware Maintenance Utility](https://kiiroo-firmware-loader.buttplug.world/), follow the instructions for updating the firmware, when prompted to select a firmware file, select the Ignition .hex file and proceed as per the instructions.

Once the firmware update process is complete, the green power LED on the Launch should pulsate slowly, this means Ignition is waiting for an application to be installed. At this point, go to the [Ignition application update tool](https://cfs6t08p.github.io/liftoff.js/update.html) to install [Liftoff](https://github.com/cfs6t08p/liftoff).

Downgrading
===========

Ignition is compatible with the original bootloader, to uninstall Ignition use the [Metafetish Unofficial Kiiroo Firmware Maintenance Utility](https://kiiroo-firmware-loader.buttplug.world/) to re-install the official 1.3 firmware. This will revert the Launch to its factory configuration.
